# ProfileGenerator
# Introduction

I have created a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. The command that I've used is ```node index.js```

The purpose of this application is to generate a PDF with the user's information on one page after the user is asked for his/her Github username and favorite color.

The username is supposed to target a specific user and the favorite color determines the theme color for the page. This ProfileGenerator PDF is supposed to make it easier to prepare reports for stakeholders.

The technology that I've used to complete this project is:
* Electron
* GitHub API

There are 2 files:

* `index.js`
* `test.js`

The PDF will be located in the Assets folder.
